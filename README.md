## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Core**: React Native, Expo
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (via NativeWind)
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Navigation**: Expo Router (file-based)
- **Testing**: Jest & React Native Testing Library

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- `npm` or `yarn`
- [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) (for macOS/Linux users)
- **For Android**: [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) with a configured Android Emulator (e.g., Pixel 6).
- **For iOS**: [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (latest version) with configured iOS Simulator (e.g., iPhone 15).

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the development environment running.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/giannis198/crypto-compass-app-v.1.git
    cd crypto-compass-app-v.1
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Choose your preferred package manager.

    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm install

    # Using yarn
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Install iOS Pods:**
    For iOS, you need to install the CocoaPods dependencies.

    ```bash
    # Navigate to the ios directory, install pods, and return to the root
    npx pod-install
    ```

    _or manually:_

    ```bash
    cd ios && pod install && cd ..
    ```

## üèÉ Running the Application

### With Expo Go (Quickest Method)

Expo Go allows you to run the app on a physical device without needing to build the native code.

1.  **Start the Metro Bundler:**

    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm start

    # Using yarn
    yarn start
    ```

2.  **Scan the QR Code:**
    - Install the "Expo Go" app on your iOS or Android device.
    - Scan the QR code shown in the terminal with your device's camera.

**Note:** This method is best for quick iteration on JavaScript/TypeScript code. If the project contains custom native modules, some features may not work, and you should use the "On Android" or "On iOS" methods instead.

### On Android

1.  **Start an Android Emulator:**
    Open Android Studio, go to the "Virtual Device Manager," and start an emulator (e.g., Pixel 6).

2.  **Run the app:**

    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm run android

    # Using yarn
    yarn android
    ```

    This will build the app and install it on the running emulator.

### On iOS

1.  **Start an iOS Simulator:**
    You can start a simulator via Xcode or the command line.

    ```bash
    # To open the default simulator
    open -a Simulator
    ```

2.  **Run the app:**
    The command will automatically select a running simulator. To target a specific one, use the `--device` flag.

    ```bash
    # Using npm (on default simulator)
    npm run ios

    # Using yarn (targeting an iPhone 15)
    yarn ios --device "iPhone 15"
    ```

### On a Physical Device

You can also run the app on a physical device using the same `run:android` or `run:ios` commands after connecting your device and trusting the computer.

## üß™ Running Tests

This project uses Jest for unit and component testing. To run the test suite:

```bash
# Using npm
npm test

# Using yarn
yarn test
```

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project follows a feature-based structure to keep the codebase organized and scalable.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Given more time, here are some improvements that could be implemented:

- **Performance Optimizations**: Further optimize flatlists and component rendering to ensure the smoothest experience on all devices.
- **Enhanced UI/UX Polish**: Add more micro-interactions, custom animations, and refine the design for an even more premium feel.
- **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSockets to provide real-time price updates without needing to pull-to-refresh.
